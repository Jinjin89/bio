# DNA methylation


## how to detect DNA methylation?

1. BeadChip(27,450K,EPIC)

    * 

2. Bisulfit techniques

    * single-base resolution

    * loss of complementarity(why? and how it matters?)

        1. All Cs are converted into Us

        2. probe design must be target specific and assue complete bisulfite conversion

3. compare infinium1 and infinium2?




## what is the difference between 450K and EPIC?

* 450K contains >450K probes(discontinued) 

* EPIC contains >850K probes


1. what is the basic structure of idat file format?



## SNP-array
what is SNP6.0?
